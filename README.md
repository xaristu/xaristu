*"My own sense of fragility or a desire to return to a simpler, more innocent state of being"*

# Who is "Xaristu"?



Xaristu is a simple, fragile human being who enjoys learning anything. Xaristu enjoys drawing, reading, etc. Xaristu goes by any preferences, but most preferably and comfortable is "He/him". 



#   ★ important 




I don’t take part in spawnism at all. Do not mistake my silence for hesitation, and do not think my distance means weakness. I keep myself far removed because I have no need to stoop so low. I will never bow to it, never lend it my attention, never allow it to stain my name. Those who dwell in it can rot there—I stand apart, untouchable.





# DNI 



*If you are an ageist, a racist, or a darkshipper, do not interact. I do not want your words, your presence, or your shadow anywhere near me. You are not welcome here, and you never will be. Whatever you cling to, whatever excuses you spit out, they crumble before me. Know this: step closer, and you will find no ground to stand on—only the weight of rejection pressing you down. Step 4726 miles away from me.*
